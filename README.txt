# Is Streamer Live? Good question.

Streamer will use command -> `/iam <streamer name>` to set their username on Twitch.
If they are live, it will show in the chat + in the tablist.

If streamer's name isn't updating, regardless of whether they are live or not, they can use: `/whoami`
Using this command will show what streamer name they set themselves to in order to assure there are no typos.

That is all. The mod checks if streamer is live periodically.
